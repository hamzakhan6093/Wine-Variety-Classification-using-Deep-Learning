# Wine-Variety-Classification-using-Deep-Learning


## Overview
A deep learning project that predicts wine varieties based on textual descriptions using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This repository contains:

- Text preprocessing pipeline
- TF-IDF vectorization implementation
- Custom ANN architecture
- Complete training/evaluation workflow
- Prediction interface for new inputs

## Key Features
- **NLP Pipeline**: Text cleaning, lemmatization, and stopword removal
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF vectorization with 1000 features
- **Deep Learning Model**: 4-layer neural network with dropout regularization
- **Label Encoding**: Automatic handling of text-based wine varieties
- **Prediction API**: Ready-to-use function for new wine descriptions

## Installation
1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamzakhan6093/Wine-Variety-Classification-using-Deep-Learning.git
cd wine-classification-ann
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download NLTK resources:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

## Dataset
The model uses wine review data containing:
- `description`: Textual wine descriptions
- `variety`: Wine grape varieties (target variable)

Sample dataset format:
| description                                | variety       |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| "Aromas include tropical fruit, broom..." | White Blend   |
| "This is ripe and fruity, a wine..."      | Portuguese Red|

## Usage
1. Train the model:
```python
python wine_classifier.py
```

2. Make predictions:
```python
from wine_classifier import predict_variety

new_description = "A bold red with dark berry flavors and oak undertones"
print(predict_variety(new_description))  # Output: Cabernet Sauvignon
```

## Model Architecture
```python
Sequential(
    Dense(512, activation='relu', input_dim=1000),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.1),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
)
```

## Performance
| Metric        | Value  |
|---------------|--------|
| Accuracy      | 85.2%  |
| Loss          | 0.428  |
| Training Time | ~2m/epoch (CPU) |
